We all have. But what about &lt;em&gt;right now&lt;/em&gt;? Do you think &lt;em&gt;future&lt;/em&gt; you will look back at &lt;em&gt;present&lt;/em&gt; you with the same mixture of amusement and slight embarrassment? Probably not. That&amp;rsquo;s because you&amp;rsquo;re likely experiencing the &lt;strong&gt;End-of-History Illusion&lt;/strong&gt; - the persistent belief that who you are now is pretty much the &amp;ldquo;finished product,&amp;rdquo; and that your tastes, values, and personality won&amp;rsquo;t significantly evolve in the years to come.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Probably not as much as you think. We&amp;rsquo;re constantly evolving, yet we often fall prey to &lt;strong&gt;Projection Bias&lt;/strong&gt;, the tendency to overestimate how much our future selves will share the same preferences, priorities, and tastes as our current selves. Understanding this bias is crucial for making better decisions in everything from career choices to financial planning.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
