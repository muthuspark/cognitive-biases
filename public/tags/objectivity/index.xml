      <description>&lt;p&gt;Have you ever been absolutely convinced you were right about something, only to later realize you were way off? Chances are, you&amp;rsquo;ve bumped into &lt;strong&gt;Naive Realism&lt;/strong&gt;, a cognitive bias that tricks us into thinking we see the world as it &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; is, objectively and without bias. It&amp;rsquo;s the insidious feeling that &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; perspective is the only correct one, and anyone who disagrees is either misinformed, irrational, or just plain wrong. This blog post will delve into the workings of Naive Realism, explore its impact on our lives, and equip you with strategies to combat it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
