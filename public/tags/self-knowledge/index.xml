Probably not as much as you think. We&amp;rsquo;re constantly evolving, yet we often fall prey to &lt;strong&gt;Projection Bias&lt;/strong&gt;, the tendency to overestimate how much our future selves will share the same preferences, priorities, and tastes as our current selves. Understanding this bias is crucial for making better decisions in everything from career choices to financial planning.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
