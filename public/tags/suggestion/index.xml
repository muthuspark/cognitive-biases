      <description>&lt;p&gt;Have you ever felt a Ouija board subtly guiding your hands? Or perhaps found yourself unexpectedly agreeing with a political commentator you usually disagree with? You might be experiencing the &lt;strong&gt;Ideometer Effect&lt;/strong&gt;, a cognitive bias that demonstrates the surprising link between our thoughts and our bodies. It&amp;rsquo;s more than just feeling influenced; it&amp;rsquo;s about how our suggestions and expectations can unconsciously drive our physical actions. Understanding this bias can help us make more rational decisions and avoid being manipulated by subtle influences.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
