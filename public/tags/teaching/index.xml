      <description>&lt;p&gt;Have you ever tried explaining a complex topic to someone, only to be met with blank stares? It might not be their lack of intelligence, but rather a phenomenon called the &lt;strong&gt;Curse of Knowledge&lt;/strong&gt;. This cognitive bias creeps into our thinking and makes it surprisingly difficult to understand how others perceive the world, especially when their understanding differs from our own.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 class=&#34;heading&#34; id=&#34;1-what-is-curse-of-knowledge&#34;&gt;&#xA;  1. What is Curse of Knowledge?&#xA;  &lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#1-what-is-curse-of-knowledge&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Curse of Knowledge&lt;/strong&gt; is a cognitive bias where better-informed people find it extremely challenging to think about problems from the perspective of lesser-informed people. Essentially, once we know something, it&amp;rsquo;s hard to imagine what it&amp;rsquo;s like &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to know it. We assume others have the same background knowledge and understanding as we do, leading to miscommunication and frustration.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
